# Confluence
Atlassian's Confluence extension, allowing you to:

 - `Search` allowing you to search all pages/blogs
 - `Popular` to view a list of what's trending
 - `People` to search for people
 - `Go` to quickly jump to useful places in Confluence
 - `Recent` for super snappy access to pages you've viewed
 - `Create Page`, `Create Blog`
 - `Switch Site` to allow to change connected Confluence site

We’d like to acknowledge, and say thanks for, the excellent prior work from @daviddkkim who built the original Confluence Search extension that we have replaced.
